## Overview
This project aims to build a simple, robust, and accurate model using various physical measurements to predict body fat percentages. Estimating body fat predictions can give valuable insight into a personâ€™s fitness level and health risks. We aim to use statistical methods to build a model that predicts body fat while ensuring that the data used is clean and abnormalities-free. 


## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains the raw and cleaned datasets used in the analysis.
- `code/`: Includes all R scripts used for data cleaning, analysis, and model building.
- `plots/`: Stores plots and visualizations generated during the analysis.
- `shiny_app/`: The code for the Shiny app, allowing real-time body fat predictions.
  
## File Descriptions 

- **data_cleaning.R**: Code for cleaning the dataset, particularly correcting abnormalities in the `bodyfat` and `height` columns.
  - In this file, data cleaning is focused on weight, height, adiposity, bodyfat, and density.
  - Calculated Adiposity is based on the formula $\frac{weight}{height^2}$, converting weight to $kg$ and height to $m$, then this value is compared with the true adiposity column in the dataset by $|calculated_adiposity - adiposity|$, setting a tolerance=5 filters one row. By looking at this data point(IDNO=42), height seems abnormal having a value of $29.5 in$. Then, height is recalculated according to adiposity and weight values and put back into the dataset.
  - Calculated bodyfat percentage is based on the formula $\frac{495}{density} - 450$ provided by Professor Kang. By calculating $|calculated_bodyfat - bodyfat|$, and setting tolerance=2, 5 rows of data are filtered out. After examining the data, bodyfat values in three rows (IDNO=48,76,216) are replaced by the calculated bodyfat. For IDNO=182, bodyfat is 0, and the calculated bodyfat is a negative value, so it seems that both bodyfat and density values are abnormal. In this case, we used $bodyfat = 1.2 * Adiposity + 0.23 * Age-16.2$ to recover. And, for the last row, IDNO=96, the density is abnormal after examination. Since density will not be used in variable selection and modeling, we will not handle this case.
- **Data_Filtering.Rmd**: Code for reviewing all other columns excluding height, weight, adiposity, bodyfat, and density in the dataset for inconsistencies.
  - we did not find any other measurements that significantly stood out. Therefore, no corrections were made to other variables.
- **Check_Assumptions.Rmd**: Code for checking and plotting regression model assumptions
- **Model_Building.R**: Code for variable selection, modeling, and bootstrapping 
- **app.R**: Shiny app code for interactive body fat prediction based on the final model.

## Statistical Analysis
The goal of this analysis was to identify the most relevant predictor variables for estimating body fat percentage. After data preprocessing, we employed an all-subset regression approach to evaluate all possible predictor combinations, with a focus on balancing the trade-off between simplicity (fewer predictors) and accuracy (higher Adjusted R-squared).
The final model selected was the two-variable model:  
`BODYFAT ~ WEIGHT + ABDOMEN`  
This model was chosen due to its optimal balance of accuracy, robustness, and simplicity.

## Shiny App
The repository includes a Shiny web app that allows users to input their abdomen and weight measurements and receive real-time predictions of their body fat percentage. The app uses the final selected model (`BODYFAT ~ WEIGHT + ABDOMEN`) for predictions. The app also allows users to choose their age group to see what category their body fat percentage falls into as adult men. The Shiny app is also deployed to an online platform and can be accessed here:

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/2023-06-17/628-Module2
2. Install necessary R packages: Install the required R libraries by running the following in R:
